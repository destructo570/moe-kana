# Learning Kana

<br />
The Japanese writing system is a unique way of writing that combines three main scripts.

- Hiragana
- Katakana
- Kanji

<br />

Hiragana is a phonetic script consisting of 46 characters. Each character represents a syllable, such as "a," "ka," or "no." Hiragana is used for writing native Japanese words and grammatical elements.

<br />
Additionally, it includes transformations called **dakuten**, **handakuten**, and
**combinations** to cover the full range of sounds in Japanese.

<br />
When learning hiragana, the first step is to begin with the five vowels:
<br /> **a** (**あ**), **i** (**い**), **u** (**う**), **e** (**え**), and **o**
(**お**), pronounced as 'ah,' 'ee,' 'ooh,' 'eh,' and 'oh,' respectively.

<br />
Following the order of the five vowels ('a,' 'i,' 'u,' 'e,' 'o'), hiragana characters
are organized into subsequent rows, each paired with different consonant sounds.
For example, after 'a,' 'i,' 'u,' 'e,' 'o,' you would progress to learn characters
like 'ka,' 'ki,' 'ku,' 'ke,' 'ko,' then 'sa,' 'shi,' 'su,' 'se,' 'so,' and so forth.

## Transformations

<br />
### Dakuten (濁点):

Dakuten, also known as **"voiced marks"** or **"ten-ten,"** are small diacritical marks that
can be added to some hiragana characters to change their pronunciation. When a dakuten
is added, the sound becomes voiced, meaning that your vocal cords vibrate when pronouncing
the character. In simple terms, it makes the sound a bit **"heavier."**

<br />
**Examples:**

- **か** (ka) becomes **が** (ga)
- **さ** (sa) becomes **ざ** (za)
- **た** (ta) becomes **だ** (da)

In each case, the addition of the dakuten (**゛**) changes the sound of the character.

<br />
### Handakuten (半濁点):

Handakuten, also known as **"half-voiced marks"** or **"maru,"** are another type of diacritical
mark. They are used with the hiragana character "**は**" (ha) to change it to a different
sound. When a handakuten is added, the sound becomes "**p**" instead of "**h.**"

<br />
**Example:**

- **は** (ha) becomes **ぱ** (pa)

Again, the handakuten (**゜**) changes the pronunciation of the character.

<br />
It's important to note that not all hiragana characters can take dakuten or handakuten.
Only certain characters are eligible for these transformations. Here's a list of
hiragana characters that can take dakuten and handakuten:
<br />
**Dakuten:** **か**, **き**, **く**, **け**,**こ**, **さ**, **し**, **す**, **せ**,
**そ**, **た**, **ち**, **つ**, **て**, **と**, **は**, **ひ**, **ふ**, **へ**, **ほ**

**Handakuten:** **は**

<br />

These diacritical marks are crucial for proper pronunciation in Japanese, and mastering them will enhance your ability to read and speak the language accurately. Practice writing and pronouncing hiragana with dakuten and handakuten to get familiar with these transformations.

## Hiragana Combinations

In Japanese, there are certain sounds that are not represented by single hiragana characters.
To cover these additional sounds, hiragana combinations come into play.

Hiragana combinations are formed by adding a small version of the hiragana character for "ya," "yu," or "yo" (や, ゆ, よ) to the other hiragana characters in the same row as "ka," "ki," "ku," "ke," or "ko" (か, き, く, け, こ). This creates new sounds that are not available in the basic set of hiragana.

Here are some examples of hiragana combinations:

- **き** (ki) + **ゃ** (ya) = **きゃ** (kya)
- **し** (shi) + **ゅ** (yu) = **しゅ** (shu)
- **ち** (chi) + **ょ** (yo) = **ちょ** (cho)

<br />
By combining hiragana characters in this way, you can accurately represent sounds
like "**kya**," "**shu**," and "**cho**" that would not be possible with the basic
hiragana characters alone.

<br />
Why do we need them? Because these combinations are used to write many important
Japanese words and sounds. They are commonly found in native Japanese words, and
you'll encounter them frequently in everyday conversations, reading, and writing.
Without hiragana combinations, it would be challenging to convey the correct sounds
and meanings of certain words in Japanese.
