# Katakana

Katakana is also a phonetic script consisting of 46 characters. Each character represents
a syllable, just like Hiragana. However, Katakana is used for different purposes.

<br />
Katakana is mainly used for writing **foreign words, loanwords, onomatopoeic expressions,
technical and scientific terms, and names of plants and animals.**

<br />
Additionally, like Hiragana, Katakana also includes transformations called **dakuten**,
**handakuten**, and **combinations** to cover the full range of sounds in Japanese.

<br />
When learning Katakana, the first step is to begin with the five vowels: **a** (**ア**),
**i** (**イ**), **u** (**ウ**), **e** (**エ**), and **o** (**オ**), pronounced as
'ah,' 'ee,' 'ooh,' 'eh,' and 'oh,' respectively.

<br />
Following the same order as Hiragana, Katakana characters are organized into subsequent
rows, each paired with different consonant sounds. For example, after **a**, **i**,
**u**, **e**, **o**, you would progress to learn characters like **ka** (**カ**),
**ki** (**キ**), **ku** (**ク**), **ke** (**ケ**), **ko** (**コ**), then **sa** (**サ**),
**shi** (**シ**), **su** (**ス**), **se** (**セ**), **so** (**ソ**), and so forth.
